				<b>What is Faith Farm?</b></br>
				</br>
				<i>
				    Faith Farm Ministries is a <strong>free, minimum 9 month, faith-based, addiction recovery program </strong>with residential services for more than 400 men and
					women who have lost control of their lives due to alcohol and/or illegal and pharmaceutical drug addiction. 
				</br></br>
					Everyone knows someone &#8230; has loved ones, friends, siblings, parents, children, co-workers and/or neighbors that suffer from addiction. It&#8217;s an epidemic! <span style="font-weight: bold">It is everyone&#8217;s
					battle.
				
				</br></span></br>
				For over 60 years, Faith Farm has served and continues to serve an ever- growing need for our program in our community at <a href="http://www.faithfarm.org/project-hope.php">no cost to our
				residents</a>. Faith Farm has also become a viable alternative to incarceration, saving thousands in tax dollars. It is estimated that over 37,000 people have been helped in Faith Farm&#8217;s
				effective addiction recovery program. </i> </br>
